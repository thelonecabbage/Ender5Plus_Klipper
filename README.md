# Ender 5 Plus (E5P, E5+) with Klipper
These are my notes for my larger E5P
The mechanics and motors are original, but the control board was upgraded for an [BTT SKR Mini v3](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003519869375.htm).  And the extruder was replaced with an Orbiter V2 & Mosquito hotend.
## **Note:** SKR Mini V3
I'm not sure I still recommend this  board.  The USB connector is constantly breaking, and the performance vs price isn't as good as it once was.  For $10 more a [Monster8 V2 + 8xTMC2209](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003998542224.html), gives you 8 ports, and 3+3 fan slots with selectable voltage.

## Sonic Pad:
Currently I am using a Creality Sonic Pad (v1), with the latest firmware.  Not a seamless experience, but a good place to start.
